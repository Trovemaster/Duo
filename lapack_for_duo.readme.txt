The file `lapack_for_duo.f' ( 3,663,126 bytes, md5sum: 564684be34c6397a169a3f7915949a41 )
contains the source code for all the BLAS/LAPACK routines necessary for DUO.

It may be used when BLAS/LAPACK is not available as pre-compiled binaries.

NOTE: when compiling do NOT use compiler flags which stop execution upon
floating point exceptions such as divide-by-zero, NaNs etc., as LAPACK
sometimes makes use of such things (eg, in the subroutine IEEECK ).

Specifically, the packaged BLAS/LAPACK is:
LAPACK v.3.6.0, downloaded from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
