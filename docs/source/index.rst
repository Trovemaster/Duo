News
====

05.01.2026: The checkpoint functionality now allows using stored eigenfunctions directly in intensity calculations thus bypassing the solution of the Schrödinger system. This functionality also includes saving/reading/computing the transition dipole/quadrupole matrix elements (external). The format of the eigenvectors checkpoint is now binary. There is a new eigenvalues .chk file. As a new feature, it can potentially contain bugs (most likely).
